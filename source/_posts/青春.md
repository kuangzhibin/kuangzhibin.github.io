###### 作者：*Samuel Ullman*（塞缪尔．厄尔曼）

> *Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind.*
青春不是年华，而是心境；

> *It is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees.*
青春不是桃面、丹唇、柔膝，

> *It is a matter of the will, a quality of the imagination, vigor of the emotions;* 
而是深沉的意志、宏伟的想象、炽热的感情；

> *It is the freshness of the deep spring of life.*
青春是生命的深泉在涌流。

> *Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity,*
青春气贯长虹，勇锐盖过怯弱，<!-- more -->

> *of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease.*
进去压倒苟安，如此锐气，

> *This often exits in a man of 60, more than a boy of 20.*
二十后生有之，六旬男子则更多见。

> *nobody grows merely by the number of years;we grow old by deserting our ideas.* 
年年有加，并非垂老；理想丢弃，方堕暮年。

> *Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.*
岁月悠悠，衰微只及肌肤；热忱抛却，颓唐必至灵魂。

> *Worry, fear, self-distrust1 bows the heart and turns the spirit back to dust.* 
烦忧、惶恐、丧失自信，定使心灵扭曲，意气如灰。

> *Whether 60 or 16, there is in every human being's heart the lure of wonders,* 
无论年届花甲，抑或二八芳龄，心中皆有生命之欢乐，奇迹之诱惑，

> *the unfailing childlike appetite of what's next and the joy of the game of living.* 
孩童般天真久盛不衰。

> *In the center of your heart and my heart there is a wireless station;* 
人人心中皆有一台天线，

> *so long as it receives messages of beauty, hope, cheer, courage and power from men and from infinite,* 
只要你从天上人间接受美好、希望、欢乐、勇气和力量的信号，

> *so long as you are young.* 
你就青春永驻，风华常存。

> *When the aerials are down, and your spirit is covered with the snows of cynicism and the ice of pessimism,* 
一旦天线倒塌，锐气被冰雪覆盖，玩世不恭、自暴自弃油然而生，

> *then you've grown old, even at 20, but as long as your aerials are up,*
几十年方二十，实已垂老矣；

> *to catch waves of optimism, there's hope you may die young at 80.*  
然则只要竖起天线，捕捉乐观的信号，你就有望在八十高龄告别尘寰时仍觉得年轻。
